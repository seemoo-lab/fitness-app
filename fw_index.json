Your smartphone app will not ask you to apply any firmware update afterwards. Wireless downgrading to an older firmware still works in this firmware, if you backed up the device encryption key. This firmware does not include any further backdoors - encryption and authentication work as normal. Loosing the device encryption key locks down your tracker to this exact firmware version, until an official newer firmware becomes available.",
